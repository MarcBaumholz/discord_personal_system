# Personal RSS News Bot - Planning Document

## Project Overview

### Purpose
Create a personal RSS News Bot for Discord that curates and delivers weekly intelligent summaries of content related to:
- Productivity & Personal Development
- AI & Latest LLM Trends/Models
- Cognitive Sciences & Breakthrough Research
- Flow States & Performance
- Automation & Personal Assistant Systems

### Goals
- **Weekly Automation**: Delivers personalized newsfeed every Sunday
- **Intelligent Curation**: Uses LLMs to analyze and summarize content
- **Quality over Quantity**: Focuses on meaningful, actionable insights
- **Personal Relevance**: Tailored to specific interests and topics

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components
1. **RSS Feed Manager**: Monitors and fetches from curated RSS sources
2. **Content Processor**: Filters and analyzes content using LLM
3. **Summary Generator**: Creates newsletter-style summaries
4. **Discord Publisher**: Posts formatted updates to specified channel
5. **Data Storage**: Tracks published content to avoid duplicates

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Discord Library**: discord.py
- **RSS Parsing**: feedparser
- **LLM Integration**: OpenRouter API (with fallback to free models)
- **Database**: SQLite (lightweight, file-based)
- **Scheduling**: APScheduler for weekly automation
- **HTTP Requests**: requests/aiohttp

## Technical Decisions

### RSS Sources Strategy
**High-Quality, Curated Sources**:
- Target 15-20 premium RSS feeds covering core interest areas
- Focus on established sources with consistent, high-quality content
- Include both academic and industry sources

**Selected RSS Feeds**:
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI Blog, DeepMind, MIT AI News, Hugging Face Blog
- **Productivity**: Harvard Business Review, MIT Technology Review
- **Cognitive Science**: Nature Neuroscience, Psychological Science
- **Automation**: TechCrunch AI, Venture Beat AI

### Content Processing Workflow
1. **Fetch Phase**: Collect new articles from all RSS sources
2. **Filter Phase**: Remove duplicates, check publication dates
3. **Analysis Phase**: Use LLM to categorize and rate relevance
4. **Summary Phase**: Generate concise summaries with key insights
5. **Newsletter Phase**: Compile into cohesive weekly report

### LLM Integration Strategy
- **Primary**: OpenRouter API for advanced models when needed
- **Fallback**: Use lighter, free models for basic operations
- **Optimization**: Smart prompt engineering to minimize API costs
- **Caching**: Store LLM responses to avoid redundant processing

### Discord Integration
- **Target Channel**: 1384292843216175266 (Discord news channel)
- **Format**: Rich embeds with sections for each topic area
- **Scheduling**: Posts every Sunday at configurable time
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with notification logs

## Database Schema

### Tables
1. **articles**: Store processed articles with metadata
2. **feed_sources**: Track RSS feed configurations
3. **summaries**: Store generated weekly summaries
4. **settings**: Bot configuration and preferences

### Key Fields
- Article: id, title, url, source, published_date, content_hash, relevance_score
- Summary: id, week_date, content, topics_covered, article_count

## Security & Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Bot authentication token
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: LLM service authentication
- `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID`: Target channel for posts
- `SCHEDULE_TIME`: Weekly posting time (default: Sunday 09:00)

### Best Practices
- Never commit sensitive tokens to version control
- Use .env files for local development
- Implement proper error logging and monitoring
- Rate limiting for API calls

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- Set up project structure and virtual environment
- Implement basic RSS feed fetching
- Create SQLite database schema
- Basic Discord bot connection

### Phase 2: Core Logic (Week 2)
- Content filtering and deduplication
- LLM integration for content analysis
- Summary generation algorithms
- Basic Discord posting functionality

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Week 3)
- Scheduling system implementation
- Error handling and logging
- Configuration management
- Testing and optimization

### Phase 4: Deployment (Week 4)
- Production deployment setup
- Monitoring and alerting
- Documentation completion
- Performance optimization

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Unit tests for core functions

### Content Quality
- Relevance scoring for articles
- Duplicate detection and removal
- Source credibility weighting
- Bias detection and mitigation

### User Experience
- Clear, readable weekly summaries
- Consistent posting schedule
- Rich formatting in Discord
- Actionable insights and links

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- 99%+ uptime for weekly posting
- <5 second response time for content processing
- Zero duplicate content in summaries
- <$5/month in API costs

### Content Metrics
- 15-25 articles processed per week
- 5-7 distinct topic areas covered
- 1000-1500 words per weekly summary
- High relevance score (>0.7) for all included content

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API Rate Limits**: Implement exponential backoff and queuing
- **RSS Feed Downtime**: Monitor feed health, have backup sources
- **LLM Costs**: Budget monitoring, fallback to free models
- **Discord API Changes**: Use stable API versions, monitor deprecations

### Content Risks
- **Low Quality Sources**: Regular source review and scoring
- **Bias in Selection**: Diverse source mix, bias detection
- **Outdated Information**: Strict recency filters
- **Content Overload**: Smart filtering and prioritization

## Future Enhancements

### Version 2.0 Features
- Interactive commands for on-demand summaries
- User preference customization
- Multiple topic channels
- Integration with other platforms (Slack, email)

### Advanced Features
- Sentiment analysis of news trends
- Predictive content recommendations
- Integration with personal knowledge management
- Community voting on content relevance

## Conclusion

This personal RSS News Bot will serve as an intelligent content curator, transforming information overload into actionable weekly insights. By combining quality RSS sources with smart LLM processing, it will deliver personalized, valuable content that supports continuous learning and professional development.

The modular architecture ensures maintainability while the focus on quality over quantity guarantees meaningful output. This system will evolve from a simple RSS aggregator into a sophisticated personal knowledge assistant.
