- [ ] Implement feed parsing and article extraction
- [ ] Add error handling and rate limiting
- [ ] Test with curated RSS feeds

### 2. LLM Integration Setup
- [ ] Create `src/llm_processor.py` for OpenRouter integration
- [ ] Implement relevance scoring algorithms
- [ ] Add content summarization functions
- [ ] Create fallback mechanisms for free models

### 3. Discord Integration

- [ ] Implement rich embed formatting for summaries
- [ ] Add Discord posting and channel management
- [ ] Test bot connection and permissions

### 4. Main Application Loop
- [ ] Create `src/main.py` orchestrating all components
- [ ] Implement weekly processing workflow
- [ ] Add scheduling and automation
- [ ] Create comprehensive logging system

## Dependencies & Prerequisites

### External Dependencies
- Discord Bot Token (from Discord Developer Portal)
- OpenRouter API Key (for LLM integration)
- Python 3.11+ environment
- Internet connectivity for RSS feeds

### Internal Dependencies
- Project structure must be established before core logic
- Database schema must be defined before content processing
- RSS feeds must be curated before content filtering
- Discord connection must work before posting functionality

## Risk Mitigation Tasks

### High Priority Risks
- [ ] Test all RSS feeds for reliability and format consistency
- [ ] Implement API rate limiting from the start
- [ ] Set up proper error logging system
- [ ] Create backup/fallback mechanisms for critical components

### Medium Priority Risks
- [ ] Monitor API costs and usage patterns
- [ ] Implement duplicate detection early
- [ ] Test Discord API rate limits
- [ ] Plan for RSS feed format changes

## Quality Assurance Tasks

### Code Quality
- [ ] Set up code linting (flake8, black)
- [ ] Implement type hints throughout
- [ ] Create unit tests for core functions
- [ ] Set up code documentation standards

### Content Quality
- [ ] Design relevance scoring algorithm
- [ ] Implement content freshness filters
- [ ] Create bias detection mechanisms
- [ ] Test summary quality metrics

## Success Criteria for Phase 1

### Technical Milestones
- [ ] Bot successfully connects to Discord
- [ ] Can fetch and parse at least 10 RSS feeds
- [ ] Database stores articles without errors
- [ ] Basic content deduplication works
- [ ] Configuration system is functional

### Quality Milestones
- [ ] Zero critical errors in logs
- [ ] All RSS feeds parse successfully
- [ ] Database operations are atomic and safe
- [ ] Code passes all linting checks
- [ ] Basic functionality is testable

## Time Estimates

### This Week (Foundation Phase)
- Project setup: 2-3 hours
- RSS source research: 2-3 hours
- Database design: 1-2 hours
- Basic RSS fetching: 2-3 hours
- Discord bot setup: 1-2 hours
- Testing and debugging: 2-3 hours

**Total estimated time: 10-16 hours**

### Next Week (Core Logic Phase)
- LLM integration: 4-6 hours
- Content processing: 3-4 hours
- Summary generation: 3-4 hours
- Discord formatting: 2-3 hours
- Testing: 2-3 hours

**Total estimated time: 14-20 hours**

## Notes and Considerations

### Development Environment
- Use Python 3.11+ for best performance
- Develop on Linux/Unix environment (matching production)
- Use virtual environment for dependency isolation
- Git for version control with proper .gitignore

### Testing Strategy
- Manual testing for RSS feed parsing
- Unit tests for core business logic
- Integration tests for Discord posting
- Mock tests for LLM API calls

### Documentation
- Code documentation with docstrings
- Configuration documentation
- Deployment guide
- User guide for bot operations

## Issue Tracking

### Current Issues
- None identified yet

### Resolved Issues
- None yet

### Future Considerations
- RSS feed rate limiting requirements
- LLM API cost optimization
- Discord message length limits
- Time zone handling for scheduling
