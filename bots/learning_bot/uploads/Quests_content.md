            I just want to welcome everybody here, to our dinner. And I want to let you know that as much as I would love to be an extraordinary host to every single one of you, my fear is that I won't be able to do that, because maybe I am a bit of an introvert(X), maybe I can't necessarily spend one on one time with all of you.
            So how about this?
            Lets just make a plan: We are all going to be hosts
            I want all of us to recognize that there is extraordinary people here, lets take caare of each other.
            If you see somebody without a drink. Ask to fill up
            If you see somebody standing by themselves, make sure that you go over and chat with them
            All the good things that a host would do, I would like to bestow my host responsibilities onto all of you, so that we can all just have an extraordinary time and all of us can be seen as the caring, wondedrful and amzing people that I know we all are. So lets just forget about all the pretense, this isn't a traditional dinner party, this isn`t a traditional party, this is a group of individuals taking care of each other, co elevating even, cheers

Food

**Roast the cauliflower**

**1.**¬†Set an oven rack 10 inches or so from the broiler. Preheat the oven to 375¬∞F.

**2.**¬†Trim the base of the cauliflower so it can sit flat. Flip the cauliflower base-side up and cut a deep ‚ÄúX‚Äù into the base, stopping when you reach the stems or the florets. This helps the core and base cook at the same rate as the rest of the head.

**3.**¬†Rub the cauliflower all over with the olive oil, then season the cauliflower all over with the salt. Set the cauliflower in a large, heavy ovenproof skillet (11- to 13-inch works best). Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast to soften up the cauliflower (it‚Äôll go from white to cream in color), 30 to 35 minutes. Pour ¬Ω cup of water directly into the skillet and keep roasting until the water has evaporated and the cauliflower has patches of light golden brown and is just tender enough to easily be pierced with the tip of a sharp knife, 20 to 25 minutes more.

**Make the jerk sauce**

**1.**¬†While the cauliflower is roasting, combine the sauce ingredients, including the finely grated zest and the juice of the lime, in a blender and blend on high speed until completely smooth, about 1 minute.

**Make the dish**

**1.**¬†When the cauliflower is tender, remove it from the oven and heat the broiler. Use a flexible spatula to rub the top and sides of the cauliflower (don‚Äôt neglect those lower sides!) with the blended mixture.

**2.**¬†Broil the cauliflower‚Äîbasting it after 5 minutes with the juices that have accumulated in the skillet and trying your best to get that flavorful liquid in all its nooks and crannies‚Äîuntil the top has spots of black char, 10 to 12 minutes. Serve hot or warm.

### **Jerk Cauliflower**

3-4

**IngredientsInstructions**

---

**For the cauliflower**

- 1 large head cauliflower (about 3 pounds), leaves removed
- 3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil

**For the jerk sauce**

- 2 tbsp brown sugar
- 1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves, or ¬Ω tbsp dried
- ¬Ω tsp black peppercorns
- ¬Ω tsp allspice berries
- 2 dried or fresh bay leaves

- 1 scallion, trimmed and roughly chopped
- 1 large garlic clove, peeled

       You can not improve what you cant meassure, so measure your reading speed
    
       first you create your habits and then your habits create you
    
       reading faster require more focus
    
       read faster is like drive faster, drive with 10km/h you get easily distracted, but when drive    
    
       with 200km/h you are totally focused
    
       use the infinity technique to connect right and left brain 
    
       how you do one thing, is how you do everything
    
    ### Action
    
       Measure your Reading speed
    
    1. read 2 minutes
    2. count the lines, divide by 2
    3. count words per line, count 4 lines and take the average
    4. multiply lines with words ‚áí reading speed per minute
    
    EXP: 
    
    60 lines in 2 min ‚áí 30lines a minute
    
    9 Words per line in average
    
    30*9 = 270 words per minute 
    
       Schedule Reading ‚áí for me every morning after wakeup 15min
    
       Focus only on reading and do not jump back
    
       Use a visual pacer(finger, pen) ‚áí use your whole arm ‚áí do not touch the page
    
       have a good posture, book angle 45 degree
    
       use your periphal vision, spot groups of words, 3 words at once and skip the first word of   
    
       each line ‚áí start with the second word in each line

    ### Ressources
    
       Shut down inner dialogue, do not limit to talking speed, which is arround 350 words per 
    
       minute, you can understand without saying every word, because we think in pictures
    
       Many words are fillwords, they do not add meaning and 95% of the words could be  
    
       understand without reading them
    
       When you count 1,2,3 then you cant say the words in your brain
    
       What you resist persist
    
       When you read your left brain is more active
    
       When you read with left hand you activate your right brain and boost creativity and 
    
       emotions
    
       The fastest readers are left handers
    
       When the human mind gets stretched with a new idea, it never will go back to past  
    
       dimensions
    
       Building your mental gym
    
       The 4-3-2-1 Method
    
    read 4 min normal speedand make a marker at the start and at the end
    
    read the same text in 3 min ‚áí then in 2 min ‚áí then in 1 min ‚áí this is how you stretch your brain ‚áí  the goal is not comprehension, it is reaching the end line ‚áí comprehension comes naturally with time
    
       I compare the 4-3-2-1 Method with my podcast listening, I started with normal speed, but 
    
       when I listen for information and not for the story I can turn up the speed to 1.5 or 
    
       sometimes even 2X of the normal speed, because my brain adapts to the speed and I am 
    
       more focused and can still understand it. ‚áí the maximum brain capacity is to 120 bits
    
       when one person in talking it needs 40 bits ‚áí you can maximum listen to 3 people at once
    
       with no other stimuly
    
       What you learn in private, is for what you get rewarded in public
    
       Our brain does not like open loops
    
       The quality of your thoughts represent the quality of your life
    
       When you ask more questions, you get more answers
    
       Consistency is power small steps at the time, when you try to much, to fast you gonna fail
    
       Show perseverance, you need momentum
    
       80% of what you read is lost after 48h
    
    ### Action
    
       Do not subvocalize ‚áí shut down inner dialogue and just count 1,2,3
    
       Use your left hand for the left page and use your right hand for the right page
    
       Use the 4-3-2-1 Method, read 4min then the same text in 3 then in 2 then in 1 min. 
    
       Stretch your mind

       The more you teach, the more you learn it ‚áí teach to others
    
       We remember easily beginning and ending 
    
       When we use the pomodoro technique, 25min of work and 5min break, we remember
