       understand without reading them

       I compare the 4-3-2-1 Method with my podcast listening, I started with normal speed, but 
    
       when I listen for information and not for the story I can turn up the speed to 1.5 or 
    
       sometimes even 2X of the normal speed, because my brain adapts to the speed and I am 
    
       more focused and can still understand it. ‚áí the maximum brain capacity is to 120 bits
    
       when one person in talking it needs 40 bits ‚áí you can maximum listen to 3 people at once
    
       with no other stimuly
