            I just want to welcome everybody here, to our dinner. And I want to let you know that as much as I would love to be an extraordinary host to every single one of you, my fear is that I won't be able to do that, because maybe I am a bit of an introvert(X), maybe I can't necessarily spend one on one time with all of you.
            So how about this?
            Lets just make a plan: We are all going to be hosts
            I want all of us to recognize that there is extraordinary people here, lets take caare of each other.
            If you see somebody without a drink. Ask to fill up
            If you see somebody standing by themselves, make sure that you go over and chat with them
            All the good things that a host would do, I would like to bestow my host responsibilities onto all of you, so that we can all just have an extraordinary time and all of us can be seen as the caring, wondedrful and amzing people that I know we all are. So lets just forget about all the pretense, this isn't a traditional dinner party, this isn`t a traditional party, this is a group of individuals taking care of each other, co elevating even, cheers
