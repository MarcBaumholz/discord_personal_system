Poem

When I run after what I think I want,

my days are furnace of distress and anxiety,

If I sit in my own place of patience,

what I need flows to me, and without any pain.

From this I understand that what I want also wants me, 

is looking for me and attracting me.

There is a great secret in this for anyone who can grasp it.

    As an entrepreneur, you can be working for a company or part of a group like NASA and still have the entrepreneur mindset.
