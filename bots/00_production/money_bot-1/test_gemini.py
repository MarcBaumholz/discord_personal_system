    Please analyze this German receipt/expense image carefully and extract the financial information.
    
    This appears to be from an Aral gas station. Look for:
    1. The total amount paid (Gesamtbetrag) in euros 
    2. What type of expense this is (likely Transport/Fuel)
    3. A brief description including the business name and what was purchased
    
    Think through the image step by step:
    - What business is this from?
    - What was purchased (fuel, etc.)?
    - What is the total amount paid?
    - What date was this transaction?
    
    Respond with valid JSON only:
