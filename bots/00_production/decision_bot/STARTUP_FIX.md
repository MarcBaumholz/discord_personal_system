# 🔧 Decision Bot Startup Fix - June 19, 2025

## Issue Resolved
Fixed a critical syntax error in `rag_system.py` where `await` was used outside an async function.

### Error Details
```python
# ❌ BEFORE (line 285 in rag_system.py):
def reload_data(self) -> bool:
    return await self.initialize()  # SyntaxError: 'await' outside async function

# ✅ AFTER:
async def reload_data(self) -> bool:
    return await self.initialize()  # Fixed: Made function async
```

## Current Status ✅
- **Bot Status**: ✅ Running successfully 
- **RAG System**: ✅ Initialized with 285 documents
- **Data Processed**: 
  - CSV files: goals.csv (8 rows), values.csv (9 rows)
  - MD files: me_content.md (110 chunks), life_content.md (158 chunks)
- **Discord Connection**: ✅ Connected and responding to questions
- **Vector Index**: ✅ Built and saved successfully

## Performance Notes
- Initial startup takes ~1-2 minutes due to embedding generation
- Subsequent startups will be faster as embeddings are cached
- Bot processes questions using both CSV fallback + RAG enhanced context
- Document categories detected: goals, values, general, career, character, emotional, family, finance, health_fitness, house_environment, intellectual, quality_of_life, social_life, spirituality

## Test Confirmation
✅ Bot successfully processed test question: "soll ich sport machne ?" with RAG-enhanced analysis

## Ready for Use
