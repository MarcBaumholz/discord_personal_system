# Life fundamentals

## **I AM ENOUGH**

Planung gibt Sicherheit. Lebensfreude kommt jedoch von wo anders. Die wirklich großen Dinge im leben sind selten geplant 

### Inspired by the Lifebook Process

Do not lose yourself on the way to the top ~Jack Welch

## Lifebook is freedom within my own Boundaries

- Your Lifebook is never done, it is a dynamic process
- lifebook is about creating your ideal life, first in your mind and then moving towards it in reality every day
- getting in touch with what you want, will make a positive change
- Lifebook is about taking responsibility for your life
- We always will have challenges, no matter how well we plan, but with a clear roadmap, we get faster on track again, it helps us to stay consistent on what we say we gonna do
- The secret about your Life is to think about it
- Lifebook is my framework in which creativity is born
- Have a Mission for every life category
- when you achieve your highest goals, you are unhappy, you need to set new goals

learn to say no to distractions, say yes to things that fit to your mission

shedule and plan it and write it down

## Erinnere dich wenn du aus der Bahn geworfen wirst an:

Du wirst das wer du bist und dafür ist es wichtig zu erkennen wer du bist. Der wahre Weg der Selbstoptimierung basiert darauf sich selbst zu erkennen, basiert darauf mutig und wahrhaftig in sein Selbst hineinzuschauen, die Schattenseiten hell zu machen und sie existieren zu lassen und möglicherweise sogar die Schönheit darin zu erkennen. Denn nur weil es diese Schattenseiten gibt, können wir die schönen Seiten in uns erkennen, nur wenn es dunkel ist schätzen wir das Sonnenlicht, nur wenn es brütend heiß ist schätzen wir den Schatten. 

Optimiere dich indem du dich selbst kennenlernst, optimiere dich indem du dir zur Aufgabe machst dich jeden tag gut zu fühlen, die Dinge zu tun, die dir ein Gefühl von Glück schenken. Doch bist du traurig, dann sei traurig und verharre in dem Zustand solange du es für wahrlich richtig hältst und denke nicht du seist unvollständig, du bist das vollständigsten Wesen das es gibt, denn du bist ein Teil dieses Lebens, ein Teil dieser Erde, ein Teil der Schöpfung von wem auch immer. Du bist gut so wie du bist, ohne aber, ohne wenn. DU BIST GUT, WEIL DU DU BIST. DU BIST GENUG!!!

~Patrick Neukirch

Who you are is important not where you go
dont break the word to yourself, do what you say

Charisma

set intention when connect with people 

4 zones ⇒ intimate(kiss,hug), personal(talk),social(say hello), public(far away)

show your hands ⇒ indiscator of trust 

Top 5 gestures
Listing => from the heart => this vs this => growth => hold how important ?

no small talks

What passion project are you working on ?

What excites you ?

What is the highlight of your day ?

Have you got anything exciting coming up in your life ?

What is your story ? 

use positive and engaging words

collaborative, engagement, excitement, creativity, love, enjoy, share, …

often we accidently talk about negative things

bad weather, bad communication, something strange happened, war

first 10 words of email, call, interaction

trigger some kind of positivity => use emotion words
lovely people, nice weather, how beautiful this room is, so happy to be here, i have been looking forward to this, lets enjoy the time together

Change words
tell me => share with me
What can I do for you ? => how can I help ?
Lets review => lets dedep dive together
Thanks for coming in => It is been wonderful to get to know you

The big 5 test

openness ⇒ new things spontanious
conscientiousness ⇒ planned focussed 
Neuroticism ⇒ stable moods, anxiety, calm down 
Extroversion ⇒ approach people outgoing 
Agreeableness ⇒ good adapter 

it is not about you being clever and the best, it is about showing others that they are the most clever and best person

Kindness is the fastest way to help yourself and others

sometimes it is better to be kind instead of smart 

daily acts of kindness

# 🔍 Reflection

Home

- morning sun ⇒ to go out and do sport stretch
    - bedroom ⇒ wake up with sunrise and see the sun
- close to the forest, green
- much light in the house and asian (japanese art and plants)
- evening sun ⇒ whirpool relax
- have light at eating place

Dont scream dont hit

if they want something they should have clear reasons, there is always a way with the right argument

Till when do I get an Answer  ?

give room and time 

kids want to get pickedup when crying 

when they come with problems ask

what do you think you need to do to fix the problem ?

be  a role model, dont be on your cellphone with your kids 

rituals and traditions, help kids be better adults, eating routine 

dont give birth while stressed, no stress in pregnancy

learn how to detox your body, as a habit 

toxins ⇒ plastic, air polution,too much sun, pesticides, bad water, not bio food 

baby is 80% lifestyle and 20% genes 

learn about functional medicine 

harte Sachen zu machen oder Dinge zu erleben bauen dein Selbstbewusstsein auf alleine durch schwierige Dinge durchgehen Kinder Erziehung

Kids
Belief Come before ability, teach you can achieve anything

Expose your children to many things, to have many Tools in your Tool chest, singularity university

Kindererziehung frage nicht die Dinge direkt. Frage immer nach ihrem Umfeld. Haben Sie Erfahrung mit Leuten die mit Drogen umgehen? Haben Sie Erfahrung mit Leuten sich schon mal gesehen, wie Leute Pornos geschaut haben und was halten Sie davon? Was ist ihr? Was sind ihre Gedanken dazu?

let them understand money is value =⇒ always provide vcalue ⇒ then ask for money 

mache weiter als biohacker in kategorie 7 weiter
und dann aus meinen learnings und denen die du denkst das ist gut für einen Biohacker, mache mir die gleiche struktur wie bei den anderen Kategorien

# 🧠 Premise Statement

> I beliefe that my spirit is a key guidance of my life. When I am lost I can ask my spirit to help me. My Spirit is the thing that gives sense to my life. My spirit is deeply personal, beautiful and unique to me. Spirtuality mirrors the onness with nature. Spiriituality is about how to serve others. True spirituality gives me the feeling of wholeness with the universe. I believe that I can find truth in everything and by combining those truths I create my ultimate truth. Being who I am let me realise that I am enough. Compassion is a circle you give and you receive in motion, but maybe not from the same person.

# 🔍 Reflection

loslassen ist die kontrolle aufzugeben => den schemrz zu akzeptieren und sein herz zu öffnen

Ursache von Leiden ist Unwissenheit

be fully alive and fully present and suffering disaüeras 

for big decisions in your life, take 2-3 days for yourself to think about it

being playful

be a satisfier instead of optimizer 

check time to be grateful to be alive 

those only are happy who have their minds fixed on some object other than their own happiness

MBSR 

practice mindfulness
