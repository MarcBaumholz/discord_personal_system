# 🤖 Discord Bots Execution Plan

## 🎯 Goal
Launch all Discord bots and start the real-time web dashboard for monitoring their status, health, and performance.

## 📋 System Overview
This is a comprehensive Discord bot collection with:
- **12+ specialized bots** (Calories, Health, Decision, Planning, etc.)
- **Real-time web dashboard** at `http://localhost:8080`
- **Auto-discovery and monitoring** of all bot processes
- **Health checks and auto-restart** capabilities
- **Live status updates** via Server-Sent Events

## 🔧 Architecture Components

### Core Services
1. **Bot Runner** (`runBots/run_all_bots.py`)
   - Auto-discovers all bot files in `/bots/` directory
   - Starts each bot as a separate process
   - Monitors health and provides restart functionality
   - Generates status files for dashboard consumption

2. **Dashboard Server** (`runBots/dashboard_server.py`)
   - Flask web server on port 8080
   - Real-time status updates via SSE (Server-Sent Events)
   - Mobile-responsive interface
   - API endpoints for status data

3. **Service Orchestrator** (`start_services.py`)
   - Manages both bot runner and dashboard server
   - Process monitoring and automatic restarts
   - Graceful shutdown handling

## 📊 Available Bots
- **Production Bots** (in `bots/00_production/`):
  - Calories Bot
  - Health Bot
  - Decision Bot
  - Erinnerungen Bot (Reminders)
  - Tagebuch Bot (Diary)
  - Preisvergleich Bot (Price Comparison)
  - Meal Plan Bot
  - Weekly Todo Bot

- **Development/Learning Bots**:
  - Weekly Planning Bot
  - Learning Bot
  - Personal RSS Bot
  - DB Bot (in improvement)

## 🚀 Execution Steps

### Step 1: Environment Preparation
- ✅ Verify Python environment and dependencies
- ✅ Check bot file locations and structure
- ✅ Ensure all required directories exist
- ✅ Set up logging and data directories

### Step 2: Path Configuration
- ✅ Adapt Docker paths (`/app/`) to local environment
- ✅ Update Python path and working directories
- ✅ Ensure proper imports and module resolution

### Step 3: Service Startup
- ✅ Start Bot Runner service
- ✅ Start Dashboard Server on port 8080
- ✅ Verify both services are running correctly

### Step 4: Bot Discovery and Launch
- ✅ Auto-discover all available bot files
- ✅ Start each bot as an independent process
- ✅ Monitor startup success/failure for each bot
- ✅ Generate initial status report

### Step 5: Dashboard Activation
- ✅ Verify dashboard accessibility at `http://localhost:8080`
- ✅ Test real-time status updates
- ✅ Confirm mobile responsiveness
- ✅ Validate API endpoints

### Step 6: Monitoring and Health Checks
- ✅ Verify process monitoring is active
- ✅ Test auto-restart functionality
- ✅ Check logging and status file generation
- ✅ Confirm graceful shutdown procedures

## 🔍 Expected Outcomes

### Dashboard Features
- **System Overview**: Total bots, running/stopped/failed counts
- **Individual Bot Cards**: Name, status, PID, uptime, path
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic refresh every 5 seconds
- **Status Indicators**: Green (running), Yellow (stopped), Red (failed)
- **Mobile Support**: Responsive design for all devices

### Monitoring Capabilities
- **Process Health**: PID tracking and uptime monitoring
- **Auto-restart**: Failed bots automatically restart
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logs for debugging
- **Status Files**: JSON status data for external monitoring

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
discord/
├── runBots/
│   ├── run_all_bots.py      # Main bot runner
│   ├── dashboard_server.py   # Flask dashboard
│   └── templates/
│       └── dashboard.html    # Dashboard UI
├── bots/                     # All bot implementations
├── data/                     # Status files
├── logs/                     # Log files
└── start_services.py         # Main entry point
```

### Key Features
- **Containerized Architecture**: Designed for Docker but adapted for local use
- **Process Isolation**: Each bot runs independently
- **Health Monitoring**: Automatic failure detection and restart
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Live status updates via WebSocket-like SSE
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works on all devices

## ⚡ Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd discord/

# Start all services (bots + dashboard)
python start_services.py

# OR start individually:
python runBots/run_all_bots.py      # Just bots
python runBots/dashboard_server.py  # Just dashboard

# Access dashboard
open http://localhost:8080
```

## 📊 Success Metrics
- All 12+ bots successfully started
- Dashboard accessible and showing real-time data
- Status updates working every 5 seconds
- Mobile interface responsive
- Process monitoring active
- Health checks functioning

## 🎯 Ready to Execute
This plan provides a comprehensive approach to launching the Discord bot ecosystem with full monitoring capabilities. The system is designed to be robust, scalable, and user-friendly with real-time insights into bot performance.
